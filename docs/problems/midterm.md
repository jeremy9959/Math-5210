# First Midterm Exam

1. Find two odd prime numbers $p$ and $q$ such that every finite group of order $pq$ is abelian and describe all possible abelian groups with this order. 

2. Find two odd prime numbers $p'$ and $q'$ for which there is a nonabelian group of order $p'q'$ and describe this group. 

3. Let $R=\Z[x]$.  Give examples, with justifications, of:
- an ideal of $R$ that is not prime.
- an ideal of $R$ that is prime but not maximal.
- a maximal ideal of $R$.

4. Let $R=\Q[x]$.  Prove that $R$ is a principal ideal domain. Let $f(x)=x^2-3x+2$ and $g(x)=x^3-1$.  Find a generator for the ideal $I=(f(x),g(x))$ in $R$. 

5. Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unity.  
1. An element $a\in A$ is called *nilpotent* if there is an
integer $n\ge 1$ such that $a^{n}=0$.  Prove that the set of all nilpotent elements in $A$ form an ideal in $A$.  
2. If $A=\Zn{m}$ where $m=p_1^{e_1}}p_2^{e_2}}\cdots p_{k}^{e_{k}}$, find the ideal $I$ of nilpotent elements in $A$.
