## Comments on HW Set 4

### Problem 1.

The most interesting part of this problem was to prove that, for $d\ge 1$ and any positive integer $n\ge 2$,
the polynomial
$$
P_{n,d}(X_1,\ldots, X_n)=X_1^{d}+X_{2}^{d}+\cdots+X_{n}^{d}-1
$$
is irreducible.  This is done by induction on $n$.  When $n=2$, the polynomial in question
is
$$
P_{2,d}=X_2^{d}+(X_1^{d}-1)
$$
which we view as a polynomial in $\Q[X_1][X_2]$.  The polynomial $X_1^d-1=(X_1-1)(q(X_1))$ where $q(1)\not=0$
($q(X_1)=1+X_1+\cdots+X_1^{d-1}$). Therefore $X_1-1$ generates a prime ideal $\mathbf{p}$ in $\Q[X_1]$ and so $P_{2,d}$ is an Eisenstein polynomial in $\Q[X_1][X_2]$ for this prime $\mathbf{p}$ and therefore irreducible.

Now suppose we know that $P_{n,d}$ is irreducible in $\Q[X_1,\ldots, X_n]$.  Since this multivariable polynomial ring is a UFD, $P_{n,d}$ generates a prime ideal.  Therefore $X_{n+1}^d+P_{n,d}$ is an Eisenstein polynomial
for that prime, and is therefore irreducible.

### Problem 3. 

We have
$$
R=F[x,y_1,y_2,\ldots]/I 
$$
where $I$ is the ideal generated by $(x-y_1^2, y_1-y_2^2,\ldots)$. The problem asks us to 
use $x^{1/2^{n}}$ for the image of   of $y_{n}$ in $R$ because 
$$
y_n^{2^{n}}\equiv x\pmod{I}.
$$
But sometimes it is more convenient just to call this element $\overline{y}_{n}$ meaning the residue class 
$y_{n}+I$. 

a. Let $R_n$ be the subring of $R$ generated by $\overline{y}_{n}$.  We are asked to show that $R$ is the union
of the $R_{n}$.  For this, suppose that $\overline{f}\in R$.  Let $f\in F[x,y_1,\ldots]$ be a representative
for this residue class.  This $f$ can only involve finitely many terms, so there is an $N$ such that 
$f$ belongs to $F[x,y_1,\ldots, y_N]$.  Since $y_{i}\equiv y_{i+1}^2\pmod{I}$ for all $i$, we know that
$f\equiv f'\pmod{I}$ where $f'$ is a polynomial
in $F[y_{N}]$.    Therefore $\overline{f}=\overline{f'}$
and $\overline{f'}$ is in $R_{N}$.  

b. We must show that $R_{n}$ is isomorphic to  polynomial ring in one variable over $F$.   If
$$
T_{n}=F[x,y_1,y_2,\ldots, y_n]
$$
we have a ring homomorphism $T_{n}\to R_{n}$ sending each variable to its corresponding variable in $R$.
The argument in part (a) shows that this is surjective, because modulo $I$ every element of $R_{n}$ is
a polynomial in $\overline{y}_{n}$. The kernel of this map is $I\cap T_{n}$. Clearly
$J_{n}=(x-y_1^2,\ldots, y_{n-1}-y_{n}^2)\subset I\cap T_{n}$.  Also $T_{n}/J_{n}$ is a polynomial ring in
the variable $y_{n}+J_{n}$.  So we will have proved that $R_{n}$ is a polynomial ring in one variable if
we prove that $I\cap T_{n}=J_{n}$.  

Let $h\in I\cap T_{n}$. Using the relations in $J_{n}\subset I\cap T_{n}$, we have
$$
h=f(y_{n})+j
$$
where $f(y_{n})$ is a polynomial in the single variable $y_{n}$.  Thus $f(y_{n})\in I$. Write
$$
f(y_n)=a_0(x-y_1^2)+a_1(y_1-y_2^2)+\ldots+a_{m}(y_{m-1}-y_{m}^2).
$$  
This means that if you make the substitutions $x=y_1^2, y_1=y_2^2,\ldots,y_{m-1}=y_{m}^2$ on the right, you get zero.
(Strictly speaking this is polynomial division with remainder, done repeatedly). 
On the left, this amounts to replacing $y_{n}$ by $y_m^(2^i)$ for some $i$, and eventually getting zero.
So the coefficients of the polynomial $f(y_n)$ must be identically zero, and so $h\in J_{N}$.

All of this proves that $R_{n}$ is isomorphic to $T_{n}/J_{n}$ which in turn is isomorphic to $F[\overline{y}_{n}]$. 

We've shown that $R_{n}$ is a PID.  Now suppose $M\subset R$ is an ideal with two generators $a$ and $b$.
Then there is an $n$ so that $a$ and $b$ are in $R_{n}$, so there is an $f\in R_{n}$ such that $a=a_1f$, $b=b_1f$,
and $ax+by=f$ for some $x,y\in R_{n}$.  Now any element of $M$ is of the form $ax+by=f(a_1x+b_1y)$ for $x,y\in R$, 
so $M\subset fR$.  Since $f\in M$, we have $fR\subset M$, and therefore $M$ is principal.

From this it's easy to see that any finitely generated ideal is principal.  

c.  Finally consider the ideal generated by $(x,\overline{y}_{1},\overline{y}_{2},\ldots)$ in $R$.  This is a proper ideal (mod out the polynomial ring by this ideal
and you get the field $F$). If this ideal were finitely generated, then by our earlier results it would be a principal ideal.  If $q$ generates this principal ideal
then $q$ belongs to $R{n}$ for some finite $n$ and $q$ is not a unit.  If $m>n$, we must have $\overline{y}_m=qr$ for some $r\in R$.  This equation must hold in $R_{M}$ for some $M\ge m$. But
$R_M$ is a polynomial ring in $\overline{y}_{M}$ and:

- $\overline{y}_{m}=\overline{y}_{M}^{2^{(M-m)}}$
- $q$ is a polynomial in $\overline{y}_{n}=\overline{y}_{M}^{2^{(M-n)}}=\overline{y}_{m}^{2^{(m-n)}}$.

The only way $y_{m}$ can be a multiple of a polynomial in $y_{m}^{2^{(m-n)}}$ where $m>n$ is if it is a constant, which is not true. 

Therefore the ideal is not finitely generated.
