## Special subgroups

Let $G$ be the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon.
- Show that the subgroup of rotations is normal.
- Let $H$ be the subgroup generated by a reflection.  What is $N_{G}(H)$? What is $C_{G}(H)$?
- What is the center of $G$?
- Draw the lattice of subgroups of $D_{2n}$.

Let $Q$ be the quaternion group with $8$ elements. Draw its lattice of subgroups.

Show that the center of $S_{n}$ is trivial if $n\ge 3.

What is the normalizer of the rotation group in  $\GL_{2}(\R)$? What is its centralizer?
Interpret this in terms of group actions.

**Theorem (Cauchy):** Any group is a subgroup of a permutation group.

Make this explicit for the Dihedral group.

Euclidean subgroup of this group.

If $H$ is normal in $G$ and $G$ is normal in $K$, is $H$ normal in $K$?
If $H$ is normal in $G$, and $f:G\to K$ is a homomorphism, is $f(H)$ normal in $K$?
