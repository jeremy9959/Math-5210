## Abstract Algebra

Math 5210/4210, Fall Semester 2022 <br>
University of Connecticut <br>

###  Instructor

- [Jeremy Teitelbaum](https://jeremy9959.net)

### Introduction

This is the first semester of the year-long graduate-level abstract algebra
course at UConn and serves as preparation for the algebra prelim exam. The 4210 version of the
course is open to undergraduates but is the same course. 

See [this page for information about the prelim exams](https://math.uconn.edu/degree-programs/graduate/preliminary-exams).  Notice that the syllabus for the prelim has been revised recently, so be sure to look at the [January, 2021
study guide](https://math.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2511/2020/12/studyguidealg.pdf).
We will cover core topics in group theory, ring theory, and linear algebra.
 

### Schedule

This course meets (in-person) every Tuesday and Thursday from 9:30 a.m. to 10:45 a.m.
in Monteith 110.

### Textbook

We will rely on *Abstract Algebra, 3rd edition* by Dummit and Foote. 

### Campus Wire

We will take advantage of the  Q&A site [campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/GE92F37A0/feed)
for online questions and answers.  You should register on the site before class starts.

### Overleaf and TeX

All homework solutions must be submitted in TeX/LaTeX.
The easiest way to work with TeX is via the cloud resource [overleaf.com](http://overleaf.com).
There are many tutorials on that site that provide an introduction to TeX.  In addition, 
[this video](https://youtu.be/C9Icf9Wvp7U) might be helpful.

### Assessment

Grades in this course will be based on:

- Homework (40%)
- Two exams (30% each)
