## Direct products

If $G_1,\ldots, G_n$ are groups, the direct product $G=G_1\times\cdots\times G_n$ is the group
whose elements are $n$-tuples $(g_1,\ldots, g_n)$, with $g_i\in G_i$, and all operations done componentwise. 

**Definition:** If $G$ is a group and $H$ and $K$ are normal subgroups of $G$ with $HK=G$ and $H\cap K$ trivial,
then the map $(h,k)\to hk$ from $H\times K\to HK=G$ is an isomorphism.  $G$ is called the internal direct product
of $H$ and $K$. 

## Fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups

**Definition:** A group is *finitely generated* if it has a finite generating set.

Finitely generated groups can be finite or infinite.  For example $\Z^{n}$ is finitely generated.

**Proposition:** An abelian group $G$ is finitely generated if and only if there is an integer $k$
and a surjective homomorphism 
$$
f:\Z^{k}\to G.
$$

**Proof:** If $f$ exists, then $G$ is generated by $f(e_i)$ for $i=1,\ldots,k$, where $e_i$ is the element of $\Z^{k}$
with a $1$ in position $i$ and zeroes elsewhere.

Conversely, if $G$ is generated by $g_1,\ldots, g_k$, define $f:\Z^{k}\to G$ by $f(e_i)=g_i$. 

**Theorem:** Let $G$ be a finitely generated abelian group.  Then there are integers $r\ge 0 $ and $n_1,\ldots,n_s$,
all at least $2$, such that
$$
G\isom \Z^{r}\times\Zn{n_1}\times\Zn{n_2}\times\cdots\times\Zn_{n_s}
$$
and such that $n_{i+1}\divides n_{i}$ for $i=1,\ldots, s-1$.
