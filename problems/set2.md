# Problem Set 2

**Instructions:** Write up your solutions using LaTeX and submit them on HuskyCT by September 25, 2022.

**Problem 1:** Let $n\ge 2$. The group $S_n$ is defined via its "natural" action on the set $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$.  From this action, and given $1\le k\le n$, we can deduce an action of $S_{n}$ on the set $P_n(k)$ of
$k$-element subsets of $[n]$ by defining $\sigma(\{a_1,\ldots, a_k\})=\{\sigma(a_1),\ldots, \sigma(a_k)\}$.
Since there are $\binom{n}{k}$ elements of $P(k)$ this action yields a homomorphism $\phi_{n,k}:S_{n}\to S_{\binom{n}{k}}$.

1. Let $n=4$.  Describe the maps $\phi_{4,1}$, $\phi_{4,2}$, and $\phi_{4,3}$. 
2. When is $\phi_{n,k}$ faithful?  In other words, when is $\phi_{n,k}$ injective?
3. Notice that $\binom{n}{n-1}=n$ so $\phi_{n,n-1}$ is a homomorphism from $S_{n}$ to itself. Describe this map.
    Is it always an isomorphism?
